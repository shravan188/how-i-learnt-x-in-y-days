

* Keep moving physically throughout the day as much as possible. Sitting more than 3-4 hours puts your body at medium risk, sitting more than 6-8 hours a day puts our body at high risk of serious health problems like heart disease, diabetes (refer 1,2,3,4,5,6)

* Light physical activities include:
    * Purchase fruits (pomogrenate, banana, tender coconut)
    * Boil water
    * Walk and explore a new street/lane/area
    * Purchase necessary items (dry fruits, surf excel)
    * Iron clothes
    * Charging devices
    * Clean table
    * Clean phone
    * Wash clothes
    * Wash blanket/bedsheet
    * Wash towel
    * Wash utensils
    * Making juices/cooking
    * Withdraw cash from ATM

* Do not use exhaustion or low energy be excuse for physical laziness, as long as you are healthy. Let physical activity cause hunger rather than waiting for energy to do physical activity

* Four levels of mental wind down during a break
    * Level 1 : Physical activity (listed above)/ Chant Hare Krishna/Learn a KC song/Read a KC book/Listen to KC lecture/ Talk to someone
    * Level 2 : Write Hare Krishna on paper while listening to one of downloaded kirtans
    * Level 3 : Listen to Spotify (Classic Detective Stories podcast by Tony Walker)
    * Level 4 : Youtube/Reddit/Quora (20 mins in the morning after breakfast outside is ok for mental activation, not more)

* Keep doing activities in small sets of 15 to 25 mins and plan only for only something which can be done within that duration. For example, instead of planning I will complete entire model documentation, plan something like I will focus on only 1 question/section in the documentation for the next 20 mins

* Of a task, 50 % can be executed in mind and the remaining 50% actually. So do the mind portion on a piece of paper first, then the real aciton

* "No matter who you are, the marginal impact of your work on the future is close to zero". Those who are meant to create a huge impact on society/create something new or something big will automatically be put into a situation (circumstances) which will make them do that. Remember that you are where you are today because of your karma, not by random chance, so make the most of it, instead of some artifical goal of changing the world

* Any material activity(like going to work) is eventually useless, but we do it because it keeps us mentally active and fresh, which is important so that we can progress spiritually. The alternative of not doing anything, which is tamas, will destroy one physically, mentally and spiritually

* Small activities which can create a positive impact 
    * Genuine compliments (you are always so helpful, compliment something they did recently, etc) (send one real/virtual thank you card or send mail to manager/supervisor praising what employee did). Do this for good customer service representatives, anytime someone does something at work that is a little above and beyond, or if they are just generally great to work with (aim to send 1 card each week)
    * Photography : Offer to take pictures for others, capture their special moments like Rajeev pr, even making videos in special cases (if feeling naughy add one selfie of your own) 
    * Reverse gossip : Talk about how good someone is when they are not around
    * If someone gets cut off talking (intentionally or not), invite them to finish their thought
    * Others : Cook for others, host people in your home, drive someone to school/hospital

* While helping others is good, always prefer short-term help or help which does not require too much energy. Long-term/high energy help should be reserved only for family and other very close people, else you will burn yourself out

* Focus on learning just 1 concept at a time. If it took you >15 days to learn Damodarastakam, what makes you think you can learn 10 MDDs in 15 days. So instead of consuming content from hundreds of different documents/videos/posts, just focus on one document/post (say 1 MDD) and complete it (need not be fully but as much as required) before even searching for the next one. Else you are just wasting time in passive consumption

* The world is a big barter system. Build a unique leverage, which you can then trage with people who have leverage in something else. Knowledge is one such asset that can be traded
