
* What you have
    * 4 hours of deep work energy


* General tips
    * Micro task strategy (one tiny step at a time)
    * Document while doing (your second brain)
    * Analyse pain points
    * Not thinking of other tasks/focusing on the present (conserving mental energy)
    * One project is all you need

* Whenever you work on something, ask yourself 1 question : What is the smallest thing I have to do to show progress a.k.a micro-task. For example
    * Adding 1 extra metric to a dashboard
    * Reviewing 1 page of a research paper
    * Watching only first 5 minutes of a video
    * Trying out 1 feature of a tool (say copilot) and documenting it
    * Learning 1 sentence in Telugu and noting new learnings
    * Instead of creating an entire presentation, just create 1 slide. Even if you dont have any additional content, you can present just that 1 slide

* To create a mental model for this, take inspiration from Jira. Just like in Jira we have `Epic (Topic) > Stories (Goal we want to achive) > Task (Single To Do) > Sub task (Breaking down into very small steps)`, similarly have a high level goal, for that a task and break that task into micro tasks that do not take more than 30 to 45 mins. 

* A micro task should be crafted such that
    * It should be doable in less than 45 mins
    * It shows progress
    * There is one new thing you can learn from the subtask

* Document while you work on task (simultaneously). It should contain Problem Statement/Requirement, how you solved, what you learnt and challenges faced. Also list down doubts you had in the process and references

* You do not need to know everything. Even if you know 1 thing with some depth that is good enough. You can gradually keep adding 1 thing at a time. Just make sure you are able to explain that 1 thing properly

* If something did not go as expected, analyse what you could have done to reduce the pain point. For example if a lot of time is going in visiting the same Sharepoint site, can you store the link in a Bookmarks file for quick access.

* Audio entertainment : Since your work puts lot of strain on eyes, try audio entertainment whenever possible

* When doing some task fully focus on that. Do not think about other tasks.
