# RagGenie Learning Journey

### High level goal : To contribute to codebase https://github.com/sirocco-ventures/raggenie

## Day 0
* Backend in app folder, frontend in ui folder
* List of important libraries used in the backend
    * Poetry (for setup)
    * FastAPI + Starlette (for backend server)
    * SQLAlchemy (for database connections)
    * psycopg2 (for postgres)
    * Loguru (for logging)
    * Langchain
    * Chromadb (vector database)
    * Onnxruntime 
    * Pydantic (data validation package)


### Doubts
1. What are abstract base classes? What is abstract method?
2. What is a mixin in Python?
3. What is Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)?
4. What s difference bw Pydantic, typing, data classes, annotations and typeddicts?
5. Can we use Trafilatura in website plugin or url reader?
